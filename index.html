   <!--includes all the things that we see on the screen --> 
   <h2>EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND</h2>
   <p>I grew up in a small town in central Washington. Shortly after highschool I dedided to go into the beauty industry.  I decided to obtain my cosmetology license through an apprenticeship program rather than the traditional beauty school route.  </p> 
    <h2>WORK HISTORY</h2>
    <p> After completing my apprenticeship I stayed in Wenatchee and worked for a small salon for a short time.  I then moved to Seattle to continue my learning and work along side a more diverse group of professionals.  I stayed in seattle  for about a year before moving back to central WA where I was self employed for roughly 6 years.  My most recent place of work has been at a salon in Spokane called House Of Pop where I have been working the last year.  </p>
    <h2>FUTURE GOALS</h2>
   
   <p>My future goals include; Landing a joob in Software Developement, purchasing some land, and starting a permaculture farm with my life partner.</p>
